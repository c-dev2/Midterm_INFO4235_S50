This project is a web application which will generate a map showing the user's current distance to the KPU Surrey campus. This app uses the Google Maps API to do this.

The starter code for this app was acquired directly from Google by following this documentation: https://developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform/maps-platform-101-react-js#0. It has been modified to add the functionality described above.

This project is part of my midterm for INFO 4235.
